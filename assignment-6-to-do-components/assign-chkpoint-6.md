### Questions

> Read Thinking in React to understand how to turn a concept for an app into a set of React components.

**A.**
I have read the suggested documentation about the conceptualization and creation of an app in Ract.

> Read React Without JSX.

**A.**
I have read the suggested document about typing plain JavaScript in React, which is perfectly valid.


> In your own words, explain what happens behind the scenes when you use JSX.

**A.**
JavaScript XML (or simply JSX) is an extension of JavaScript. As stated in React's website JSX is "syntactic sugar". Basically JSX gets interpreted by a transpiler like Babel and then it is rendered to JavaScript code that React can understand so that components can be properly displayed in the browser.
